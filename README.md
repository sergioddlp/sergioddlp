# Hello! ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sergio

Data Engineer and AI specialist with a strong passion for data science and engineering. I have a hybrid profile that combines software development and advanced data analysis. I specialize in extracting value from data by applying NLP techniques, geospatial visualization, and sentiment analysis. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Visual Analytics & Big Data, where I am deepening my knowledge in tools such as Apache Spark, HDFS, Tableau, Power BI, and advanced Python libraries for AI and visualization.
